== Frequently Asked Questions ==


Why does this include jquery

* Newer versions of wordpress include jquery automatically.  I am including it here to support old versions.

What is with the question mark

* There is a very small question mark included in the clock that leads you to the information page for this widget. This is to spread the word about my widget to other people who be interested in installing it. You can remove this if you like, but I would really appreciate some other form of attribution (blog post, blogroll link, or whatever)
